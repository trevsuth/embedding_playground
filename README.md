# Embedding Playground
## Me teaching me about embeddings and  the genesim lib

All examples are built off the 50 dimension, 6B glove embeddings.  To prepare your working directory:
- Download https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
- unzip the file.
- scripts assume the presence of glove.6B.50d.txt in your directory.  All other versions can be deleted.
